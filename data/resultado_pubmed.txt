TI  - In vitro mineral apposition analysis of two Colombian plant extracts on
      Amelogenesis imperfecta teeth.
PG  - 336-349

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if native Colombian Piper marginatum Jacq. and Ilex
      guayusa Loes plant extracts have a remineralizing effect on teeth with
      Amelogenesis imperfecta in comparison with the commercial products Clinpro-3M and
      Recaldent. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An in vitro study was carried out with 128 human
      teeth slices (64 healthy and 64 with Amelogenesis imperfecta) on which an initial
      Raman spectroscopy was performed followed by Raman spectroscopies at 0, 24, 48,
      and 72 h to determine possible remineralization by observing mineral increase or 
      decrease as a result of P. marginatum Jacq. and I. guayusa Loes extract
      application in comparison to control substance (Clinpro and Recaldent)
      application. Obtained data were analyzed using a bivariate method with a t
      unidirectional test. Significant differences among groups were determined by an
      ANOVA with Dunnett post hoc tests. RESULTS: Native I. guayusa Loes and P.
      marginatum Jacq. Colombian plants extracts exhibited phosphate and orthophosphate
      mineral apposition, where P. marginatum Jacq. presented better results.
      CONCLUSIONS: Native Colombian I. guayusa Loes and P. marginatum Jacq plant
      extract might in the future be useful for dental tissue remineralization, as they
      induced phosphate and orthophosphate mineral apposition, main components of tooth
      enamel. These types of natural compounds can become an alternative to fluorine,
      whose ingestion is harmful to the human body.

TI  - Effect of Cocoa Bean Shell Addition on Metabolite Profile and Antioxidant
      Activity of Herbal Infusions.
PG  - 9915797
LID - 10.1155/2021/9915797 [doi]
AB  - Cocoa bean shell (CBS) is a by-product with aromatic characteristics that can
      enhance the aroma and bioactivity of herbal infusions. This study was aimed to
      determine the effect of the addition of cocoa bean shell on the metabolite
      profile and antioxidant activity of infusions made with Ilex guayusa and
      Vernonanthura patens and their mixtures. Metabolite profile was analyzed by gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with multivariate analysis. Total
      polyphenol content and flavonoids were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method
      and by the flavonoid-AlCl3 complex, respectively. Antioxidant activities were
      measured by the decolorization assay of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical
      and the ferric reducing antioxidant power. The results revealed that the addition
      of CBS increases the content of phenolic acids in the infusions (caffeic acid,
      4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and pyrocatechol). Nonetheless, the antioxidant activity
      of the infusions decreased with the addition of CBS (16.21 to 2.74 TEAC).
      Carboxylic acids and derivatives, major compounds present in the infusions
      prepared with V. patens, were the metabolites that showed the highest correlation
      with the antioxidant activity. This study suggests that the infusions made with
      CBS present a profile of metabolites different from the infusions of I. guayusa, 
      V. patens, and their mixtures.

TI  - Acute oral toxicity of a novel functional drink based on Ilex guayusa,
      Vernonanthura patens, and cocoa husk.
PG  - 747-752
LID - 10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.03.026 [doi]
AB  - A novel functional drink with nutraceutical properties was formulated from the
      aqueous extracts of Ilex guayusa, and Vernonanthura patens leaves, and cocoa
      husks. This juice contains various bioactive compounds, such as phenolic
      compounds and methylxanthines, with antioxidant and stimulant properties of
      pharmacological interest. However, it is known whether herbal extracts'
      interaction may have adverse toxic effects on human health. To evaluate this
      functional drink's innocuity, we estimated the acute oral toxicity (AOT) in
      experimental mice. This paper presents the AOT evaluation of two formulations of 
      a functional drink (pre-formulation and microencapsulation) at a single dose of
      2000 mg/kg of body weight (b.w.). No signs of adverse toxicity and mortality were
      observed after a single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg b.w. Likewise, no significant
      body and organ weight changes, food and water consumption behavior, and no
      histopathological changes were observed in the main organs evaluated. In
      conclusion, this functional drink can be categorized as low toxicity " according 
      to the Globally Harmonized Classification System (GHS), making it a potential
      beverage with high nutritional and pharmacological value.

AB  - The use of guayusa (Ilex guayusa Loes.) leaves as functional food has increase
      recently. This work discusses the antioxidant activity and volatile compounds of 
      guayusa leaves extract and fractions. The methanol crude extract was obtained by 
      maceration, subsequently hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions
      were collected by solvent-solvent partition. Total phenolic content (TPC), total 
      flavonol/flavone content (TFC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical
      scavenging activity, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were measured
      by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry. The results revealed that
      ethyl acetate fraction showed highest inhibition against DPPH radical (93.86 +/- 
      0.95%) at 500 microg/mL, and reduce the ferric-tripyridyltriazine complex
      (Fe(3+)-TPTZ) at 1619.81 mg trolox equivalent (TE)/g, followed by aqueous
      fraction. This bioactivity could be related to phenolic acids, flavones and
      flavonols content, as well as the caffeine, dodecanoic acid isopropyl ester,
      caffeic acid, and malic acid identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
      (GC-MS). These findings support the antioxidant properties of this plant
      material.

AB  - The present study carried out the optimisation of the total polyphenol content
      (TPC) extraction assisted by ultrasound in Ilex guayusa leaves applying response 
      surface methodology (RSM). Also, the evaluation of the antioxidant activity of
      the extract obtained under the optimal extraction conditions was performed. The
      effect of the variables like, time of sonication, temperature, ethanol/water
      ratio and solid/liquid relationship and the interactions between them were
      analysed through the use of a factorial design 2^4. The significant factors were 
      considered for the optimisation, employing a Box-Behnken Design, and the TPC as
      response variables. It was found that a quadratic model was adequate, with an
      adjusted R(2) value of 0.9367. The optimal conditions proposed, by the response
      surface model were: an extraction temperature of 60 degrees C, sonication time of
      29.9 min and ethanol/water ratio of 76.8/23.2. The optimised leaves extract of I.
      guayusa show a TPC of 3.46 (+/-0.17) g gallic acid equivalents/100 g d.w. Radical
      scavenger activity of the obtained extract at optimum conditions, was performed
      through the FRAP and ABTS methods, given as result: 0.080 mmol TROLOX
      equivalents/100 g d.w. and 40.71 mumol TROLOX equivalents/g d.w., respectively.
      Due to the present findings, I. guayusa extracts can be proposed as a promising
      component for functional beverages, cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulation.

AB  - Due to rapid international market development, there is a strong and urgent need 
      to assess the safety of the novel food, Ilex guayusa. Guayusa has been consumed
      for centuries in the western Amazon as an herbal tea, and novel food regulation
      provide a detailed framework for safety assessment of novel foods with such a
      history of use. This study reviews guayusa's taxonomy, chemical composition,
      toxicology, ethnobotany, and history of safe use as key elements of a robust
      novel food safety assessment. Guayusa is a product of traditional agricultural
      systems with a continuous history of consumption in Ecuador. Its known chemical
      composition appears to present no greater risk to human health than existing teas
      such as green tea or yerba mate, although our understanding of guayusa's chemical
      profile is still nascent, requiring further investigation. Broad consumption of
      guayusa is not associated with a history of adverse effects or product safety
      notifications. Biochemical and phytochemical studies have profiled its
      nutritional content, metabolite composition, and bioactivity, validating
      guayusa's antioxidant and stimulant properties. In conclusion, guayusa leaves
      have a well-documented chemical composition and history of safe use, which are
      key considerations for authorization as a novel food in the EU.

TI  - LC-MS Metabolomics and Chemotaxonomy of Caffeine-Containing Holly ( Ilex) Species
      and Related Taxa in the Aquifoliaceae.
PG  - 5687-5699
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.8b07168 [doi]
AB  - Ilex species have been consumed traditionally as medicinal teas worldwide. Though
      the presence of caffeine has been reported in several species, little is known
      about secondary-metabolite diversity within and among these taxa. Leaf samples of
      Ilex guayusa, Ilex paraguariensis, and Ilex vomitoria were analyzed by liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry and comparative metabolite profiling with Ilex
      cassine and other Ilex species to identify chemotaxonomic markers, delimit
      species, and provide an assessment of chemodiversity. Purine alkaloids were
      detected and quantified in I. guayusa, I. paraguariensis, and I. vomitoria.
      Reports of caffeine for I. cassine were not corroborated, suggesting that I.
      vomitoria was the traditional source of the Native North American tea yaupon. The
      tetramethyluric acid, theacrine, was detected for the first time in the genus
      Ilex as a low-level chemotaxonomic marker in I. vomitoria samples. Chemotaxonomy 
      and metabolomics support a close relationship for caffeine-containing Ilex
      species.

AB  - Unlike all other caffeinated plants, guayusa (Ilex guayusa Loes.) and mate (Ilex 
      paraguariensis A. St. Hill) contain high amounts of pentacyclic triterpenoid
      acids and alcohols. A phytochemical investigation on these plants revealed a
      similar triterpenoid profile and a content of ursolic acid (0.7-1%) and amyrin
      esters (up to 0.5%), quite unusual for dietary plants. The major constituent of
      the amyrin complex from both plants is alpha-amyrin palmitate (2a), accompanied
      by lower amounts of its corresponding palmitoleate (2b) and by the corresponding 
      constitutional isomers from the beta-series (3a and 3b, respectively). Ursolic
      acid (1) was identified as the responsible for the activity of mate and guayusa
      extracts in the activation of TGR5, a nuclear receptor of relevance for the
      prevention and management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome because of its
      involvement in the regulation of energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity.

      daily life. Tea from Camellia sinensis is widely available and is a good source
      of caffeine and other bioactive compounds (e.g., polyphenols and carotenoids).
      Other tea-like beverages, such as those from the genus Ilex, the large-leaved
      Kudingcha (Ilex latifolia Thunb and Ilex kudingcha C.J. Tseng), Yerba Mate (Ilex 
      paraguariensis A. St.-Hil), Yaupon Holly (Ilex vomitoria), and Guayusa (Ilex
      guayusa Loes) are also traditional drinks, with lesser overall usage, but have
      attracted much recent attention and have been subjected to further study. This
      review summarizes the distribution, composition, and health benefits of
      caffeinated beverages from the genus Ilex. Plants of this genus mainly contain
      polyphenols and alkaloids, and show diverse health benefits, which, as well as
      supporting their further popularization as beverages, may also lead to potential 
      applications in the pharmaceutical or nutraceutical industries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic periodontitis is a multifactorial infectious disease, where
      multiple bacteria, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and
      Fusobacterium nucleatum are implicated. The main purpose of researching natural
      products is to find substances or compounds with antimicrobial activity. AIM: The
      objective of this work was to determine antimicrobial activity from extracts and 
      obtained fractions from Piper marginatum Jacq and Ilex guayusa Loes on P.
      gingivalis ATCC 33277, F. nucleatum ATCC 25586, and P. intermedia ATCC 25611.
      METHODS: Total ethanol extracts were obtained from both plants. Fractions were
      obtained from total ethanol extracts with amberlite as a stationary phase
      employing hexane, acetone, and ethanol-water as solvents. Qualitative and
      quantitative phytochemical characterization was performed on total ethanol
      extracts from both plants. Antimicrobial activity from total ethanol extracts and
      fractions from both plants were evaluated on P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, F.
      nucleatum ATCC 25586, and P. intermedia ATCC by the well diffusion method with
      Wilkins-Chalgren agar. RESULTS: Piper marginatum Jacq total ethanol extract
      presented antimicrobial activity against all three bacteria, whereas Ilex guayusa
      Loes was only efficient against P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and P. intermedia ATCC
      25611, with inhibition halos from 9.3 to 30 mm. Ilex guayusa Loes obtained
      fractions presented antimicrobial activity against all three microorganisms
      evaluated, with inhibition halos ranging from 9.7 to 18.7 mm. In regards to Piper
      marginatum Jacq fractions, inhibition halos were between 8.3 and 19 mm, against
      all three microorganisms evaluated; only hexane fraction did not present
      antimicrobial activity against F. nucleatum ATCC 25586. CONCLUSION: Piper
      marginatum Jacq and Ilex guayusa Loes total ethanol extracts and fractions
      presented outstanding antimicrobial activity against P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, P.
      intermedia ATCC 25611, and F. nucleatum ATCC 25586.

AB  - In general, preparations of coffee, teas, and cocoa containing high levels of
      polyphenols, L-theanine and other bioactive compounds selectively enhance mood
      and cognition effects of caffeine. This review summarizes the bioactive
      components of commonly consumed natural caffeine sources (e.g. guayusa, mate and 
      camellia teas, coffee and cocoa) and analyzes the psychopharmacology of
      constituent phytochemicals: methylxanthines, polyphenols, and L-theanine. Acute
      and chronic synergistic effects of these compounds on mood and cognition are
      compared and discussed. Specific sets of constituent compounds such as
      polyphenols, theobromine and L-theanine appear to enhance mood and cognition
      effects of caffeine and alleviate negative psychophysiological effects of
      caffeine. However, more research is needed to identify optimal combinations and
      ratios of caffeine and phytochemicals for enhancement of cognitive performance.

LID - 10.1039/c7fo01067b [doi]
AB  - Ilex guayusa tea preparations are now commercially available as Runa tea. Little 
      is known regarding the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactivities of this
      tea. The I. guayusa teas had a total polyphenolic content between 54.39 and 67.23
      mg GAE per g dry mass and peroxyl radical scavenging capacities between 1773.41
      and 2019 mumol TE per g dry mass, nearly half of that for the Camellia sinensis
      teas. The I. guayusa teas afforded 60-80% protection from oxidative stress in the
      Caco-2 cellular antioxidant assay, comparable to the C. sinensis teas. The
      anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells of I.
      guayusa teas was similarly comparable to the C. sinensis teas with nitric oxide
      production reduced by 10-30%. Major compounds identified by mass spectrometry
      were the phenolic mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acid derivatives. I. guayusa teas
      are a good source of dietary phenolic compounds with cellular antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory properties.

TI  - Changes in phytochemical composition, bioactivity and in vitro digestibility of
      guayusa leaves (Ilex guayusa Loes.) in different ripening stages.
PG  - 1927-1934
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.8675 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guayusa (Ilex guayusa Loes.) leaves, native of the Ecuadorian Amazon,
      are popularly used for preparing teas. This study aimed to assess the influence
      of leaf age on the phenolic compounds and carotenoids and the bioactivity and
      digestibility (in vitro) of aqueous and hydroalcoholic leaf extracts. RESULTS: In
      total, 14 phenolic compounds were identified and quantified. Chlorogenic acid and
      quercetin-3-O-hexose were the main representatives of the hydroxycinnamic acids
      and flavonols respectively. Seven carotenoids were quantified, lutein being the
      main compound. Ripening affected phenolic content significantly, but there was no
      significant difference in carotenoid content. Antioxidant capacity, measured by
      the DPPH(*) method, was also significantly affected by leaf age. The measurement 
      of in vitro digestibility showed a decrease in phenolic content (59%) as well as 
      antioxidant capacity, measured by the ABTS(*+) method, in comparison with initial
      conditions of the guayusa infusion. Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory
      activities were assayed with young leaves owing to their higher phenolic
      contents. Guayusa did not show any antibacterial activity against Escherichia
      coli ATCC 25922 or Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Finally, the hydroalcoholic 
      and aqueous extracts exhibited high in vitro anti-inflammatory activity (>65%).
      CONCLUSION: Young guayusa leaves have potential applications as a functional
      ingredient in food and pharmaceutical industries. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical

TI  - Guayusa (Ilex guayusa L.) new tea: phenolic and carotenoid composition and
      antioxidant capacity.
PG  - 3929-3936
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.8255 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guayusa (Ilex guayusa Loes) is an evergreen tree native of South
      America that grows particularly in the upper Amazon region of Ecuador. For its
      health benefits, it has been cultivated and consumed since ancient times by
      Amazon indigenous tribes. RESULTS: A total of 14 phenolic compounds were
      identified and quantified. Chlorogenic acid and quercetin-3-O-hexose were the
      main representatives of the hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonols, respectively.
      Five carotenoids were identified, showing lutein the highest concentration.
      Guayusa leaves revealed high antioxidant capacity determined by two analytical
      methods, DPPH and ORAC. The industrial processing applied to the leaves modified 
      the composition of bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity of guayusa. In
      general, blanched guayusa retained the concentration of phenolic compounds and
      some carotenoids and similar antioxidant capacity as untreated green leaves. In
      contrast, fermentation reduced the content of bioactive compounds and showed the 
      lowest antioxidant capacity. CONCLUSION: Therefore, blanched guayusa has
      potential for product development as a functional ingredient in the food
      industry. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - General and Genetic Toxicology of Guayusa Concentrate (Ilex guayusa).
PG  - 222-42
LID - 10.1177/1091581815625594 [doi]
AB  - Tea from the leaves of guayusa (Ilex guayusa) has a long history of consumption
      by Ecuadorian natives in regions where the plant is indigenous. The tea contains 
      the methylxanthines caffeine and theobromine as well as chlorogenic acids,
      flavonoids, and sugars. Various studies were performed to evaluate the general
      and genetic toxicology of a standardized liquid concentrate of guayusa (GC).
      Guayusa concentrate was found to be negative in in vitro genotoxicity tests
      including the Ames test and a chromosome aberration study in human lymphocytes.
      The oral median lethal dose (LD50) of GC was >5,000 mg/kg for female rats.
      Guayusa concentrate was administered to male and female rats in a 90-day
      subchronic study at 1,200, 2,500, and 5,000 mg/kg/d of GC and a caffeine-positive
      control at 150 mg/kg/d corresponding to the amount of caffeine in the high-dose
      GC group. Effects observed in the GC-treated groups were comparable to those in
      the caffeine control group and included reductions in body weights, food
      efficiency, triglycerides values, and fat pad weights and increases in blood
      chemistry values for serum aspartate aminotransferase, serum alanine
      aminotransferase, and cholesterol and adaptive salivary gland hypertrophy. No
      signs of incremental toxicity due to any other components of guayusa were
      observed. The studies indicate no harmful effects of GC in these test systems.

TI  - Amazonian ethnobotany and the search for new drugs.
PG  - 106-12; discussion 112-5
AB  - Tropical rain forests offer enormous prospects for the discovery of new drugs for
      use in Western medicine. The Amazon supports 80,000 species of higher plants and 
      a diverse Indian population. Focusing attention on those plants used as medicines
      by indigenous peoples is the most efficient way of identifying the plants that
      contain bioactive compounds. There is an urgent need for more ethnobotanists and 
      ethnopharmacologists to be trained to document as much information as possible
      before it and the plants are lost through destruction of the rain forest and
      acculturation of the indigenous peoples. Ethnobotanical studies have identified
      plants documented by early travellers; these include Paullinia yoco and Ilex
      guayusa which are used as stimulants and have been shown to be rich in caffeine. 
      Studies of the hallucinogen prepared from Banisterioposis caapi have shown that
      the native people know which plants to add to the mixture to lengthen and
      intensify the intoxication produced by the beta-carboline alkaloids in the plant.
      Three major snuffs are used in the Amazonia; the plants from which they are
      derived have been identified. One of the snuffs also has antifungal and
      curare-like activities; chemical analysis on the active principles has not been
      done. Several plants are considered as prime candidates for scientific study as
      sources of useful chemicals for medicine or industry. These include some used to 
      prepare teas or other infusions for treatment of various symptoms of senile
      dementia.

TI  - Ritualistic use of the holly Ilex guayusa by Amazonian Jivaro Indians.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - In Amazonian Peru and Ecuador leaf decoctions of the rainforest holly Ilex
      guayusa with high caffeine concentrations are used as a morning stimulant. After 
      daily ingestion, ritualistic vomiting by male Achuar Indians, better known as
      Jivaros, reduces excessive caffeine intake, so that blood levels of caffeine and 
      biotransformed dimethylxanthines do not cause undesirable CNS and other effects. 
      Emesis is learned and apparently not due to emetic compounds.

TI  - Glycaemic effects of traditional European plant treatments for diabetes. Studies 
      in normal and streptozotocin diabetic mice.
PG  - 69-73
AB  - Twelve plants used for the traditional treatment of diabetes mellitus in northern
      Europe were studied using normal and streptozotocin diabetic mice to evaluate
      effects on glucose homeostasis. The plants were administered in the diet (6.25%
      by weight) and/or as decoctions or infusions in place of drinking water, to
      coincide with the traditional method of preparation. Treatment for 28 days with
      preparations of burdock (Arctium lappa), cashew (Anacardium occidentale),
      dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), elder (Sambucus nigra), fenugreek (Trigonella
      foenum-graecum), guayusa (Ilex guayusa), hop (Humulus lupulus), nettle (Urtica
      dioica), cultivated mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), periwinkle (Catharanthus
      roseus), sage (Salvia officinale), and wild carrot (Daucus carrota) did not
      affect the parameters of glucose homeostasis examined in normal mice (basal
      plasma glucose and insulin, glucose tolerance, insulin-induced hypoglycaemia and 
      glycated haemoglobin). After administration of streptozotocin (200 mg/kg) burdock
      and nettle aggravated the diabetic condition, while cashew, dandelion, elder,
      fenugreek, hop, periwinkle, sage and wild carrot did not significantly affect the
      parameters of glucose homeostasis studied (basal glucose and insulin,
      insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, glycated haemoglobin and pancreatic insulin
      concentration). Guayusa and mushroom retarded the development of hyperglycaemia
      in streptozotocin diabetes and reduced the hyperphagia, polydipsia, body weight
      loss, and glycated haemoglobin. Mushroom also countered the initial reduction in 
      plasma insulin and the reduction in pancreatic insulin concentration, and
      improved the hypoglycaemic effect of exogenous insulin. These studies suggest the
      presence of potentially useful antidiabetic agents in guayusa and mushroom.

TI  - A multidisciplinary overview of intoxicating snuff rituals in the western
      hemisphere.
PG  - 3-49
AB  - Part one of the paper discusses ethnobotanical, chemical and general
      pharmacological aspects of intoxicating snuff rituals in the western hemisphere. 
      Four categories of ritual snuff ingredients arise from this multidisciplinary
      approach: It is well established that the plant contains one or more psychoactive
      principles and the Indian use of the plant as a ritual snuff ingredient is
      confirmed or quite probable: Anadenanthera, Erythroxylum, Nicotiana, Virola; It
      is well established that the plant contains one or more psychoactive principles, 
      but the Indian use of the plant as a ritual snuff ingredient is not well recorded
      or even unlikely: Banisteriopsis, Cannabis, Datura, Ilex guayusa; The Indian use 
      of the plant as a ritual snuff ingredient is confirmed or quite probable, but it 
      is not well established that the plant contains one or more psychoactive
      principles: Justicia pectoralis, Pagamea macrophylla, Tanaecium nocturnum; The
      Indian use of the plant as a ritual snuff ingredient is not well recorded, and it
      is not well established that the plant contains one or more psychoactive
      principles: Acorus calamus, Capsicum, Macquira sclerophylla, Piper interitum.
      Part two of the paper discusses the nasal pharmacokinetics and efficacy of
      possible ritual snuff constituents. The literature yields convincing clinical
      evidence that atropine, cocaine, nicotine and scopolamine are effective following
      nasal application, but experimental confirmation of the efficacy of nasal
      tryptamine alkaloids is still awaited. In self-experiments, 6.4 mg/kg of caffeine
      produced substantial plasma levels via the nasal route, but 0.5 mg/kg of harmine 
      did not produce measurable plasma levels, when taken as a nasal powder. Without
      additional experiments, it is difficult to give a definite explanation for this
      negative result.
